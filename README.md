Check out the full walkthrough on YouTube that breaks down the challenge and shows you how to solve it.

## About the Challenge

The ‚ÄúFind the Missing Digit‚Äù coding challenge is a classic problem often encountered in interviews, coding bootcamps, and online platforms like LeetCode or CodeSignal. It tests your ability to manipulate strings, arithmetic logic, and handle edge cases.

### The Problem Statement

You are given a simple arithmetic equation where **exactly one digit (0-9) has been replaced with a question mark (`?`)**. Your task is to determine which digit belongs in the place of `?` so that the equation is valid. 


**Example:**

Input: `"1? + 23 = 35"`  
Output: `2` (because 12 + 23 = 35)

Input: `"31 - ?2 = 150"`  
Output: `-1` (because no digit can result in `150`)

---

### Constraints

- Your code must handle the following operations:
  - **Addition (`+`)**
  - **Subtraction (`-`)**
  - **Multiplication (`*`)**
  - **Division (`/`)** (integer division only, no remainders, and never divide by zero)

- The `?` can appear anywhere in the numbers on the left or right of the equation.
- There will only be one missing digit.
- Equations will always be provided as a string, and should be formatted as `"{integer} {operator} {integer} = {integer}"`.
- Return `-1` if it is impossible to create a mathematically correct equation or invalid input was received.

### Edge Cases

- Division by zero must be avoided.
- Expressions with multiple `?` should be rejected or handled appropriately (the provided code assumes only one `?`).
- Ensure all numbers are valid integers after replacement.
- Reject answers that would result in numbers like `012` or `00` (not valid integers).

### What You Learn by Solving This

- **String manipulation and parsing**‚Äîcritical for real-world data processing.
- **Defensive coding**‚Äîvalidating inputs, avoiding runtime errors, handling unexpected or malformed data.
- **Understanding problem requirements**‚Äîpaying close attention to rules like ‚Äúno leading zeros‚Äù or valid math.

Keep practicing challenges like this to build up the instincts and skills you need to excel in real-world coding and interviews!
