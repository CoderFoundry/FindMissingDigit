## About the Challenge

The ‚ÄúFind the Missing Digit‚Äù coding challenge is a classic problem often encountered in interviews, coding bootcamps, and online platforms like LeetCode or CodeSignal. It tests your ability to work with strings, arithmetic logic, and edge case validation‚Äîall skills every developer needs.

### The Problem Statement

You are given a simple arithmetic equation where **exactly one digit (0-9) has been replaced with a question mark (`?`)**. Your task is to determine which digit belongs in the place of `?` so that the equation is valid.

**Typical Example:**

Input: 1? + 23 = 35
Output: 2 (because 12 + 23 = 35)

---

### Supported Operations

Your code must handle:
- **Addition (`+`)**
- **Subtraction (`-`)**
- **Multiplication (`*`)**
- **Division (`/`)** (integer division only, no remainders, and never divide by zero)

The `?` can appear anywhere in the numbers on the left or right of the equation.

### Key Challenges & Pitfalls

- **String Parsing:** The input is a single string, so you need to split it into numbers and operators.
- **Single Digit Only:** Only one digit is missing and must be replaced.
- **No Leading Zeros:** Numbers cannot have leading zeros (e.g., `03 + 2 = 5` is invalid).
- **Valid Equations Only:** Only return a digit if it creates a mathematically correct equation.
- **Brute-force Approach:** The standard way to solve is to try every digit from 0 to 9, replacing the `?` and checking if the equation works.

### Edge Cases

- Division by zero must be avoided.
- Expressions with multiple `?` should be rejected or handled appropriately (the provided code assumes only one `?`).
- Ensure all input numbers are valid integers after replacement.
- Reject answers that would result in numbers like `012` or `00` (not valid integers).

### What You Learn by Solving This

- **String manipulation and parsing**‚Äîcritical for real-world data processing.
- **Defensive coding**‚Äîvalidating inputs, avoiding runtime errors, handling unexpected or malformed data.
- **Testing all possibilities**‚Äîbrute-force logic with performance considerations.
- **Understanding problem requirements**‚Äîpaying close attention to rules like ‚Äúno leading zeros‚Äù or valid math.

### Why Interviewers Love This Challenge

- It‚Äôs short but covers several vital skills at once.
- There‚Äôs room for mistakes (easy to overlook edge cases).
- Forces you to write clear, readable code that‚Äôs easy to test and debug.

## Why Practice Challenges Like This?

Consistent practice with problems like these:
- Builds confidence for real technical interviews.
- Sharpens your logic, reasoning, and coding style.
- Exposes you to common mistakes and edge cases (like leading zeros!).
- Makes you a better, faster, and more thoughtful developer.

If you get stuck, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîreview the code, watch the video, and try again. **Mastery comes with repetition!**
